# Action
 **Action** is an app that reminds users to focus on eco-friendly behaviors in their daily lives. **Action** calls a lot of device sensors (light sensor/acceleration sensor/gravity sensor, etc.), and integrates Google Awareness Api and Transition Api to help applications sense user behavior (such as picking up the phone, walking, running, etc.) and changes in the surrounding environment ( brightness/location, etc.), and give corresponding environmental protection suggestions.

Technically, JetPack is heavily used, and the interface follows the Material You design specification.

The database is stored in LeanCloud.
